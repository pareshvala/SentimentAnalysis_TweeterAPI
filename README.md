# SentimentAnalysis_TweeterAPI

Here, I've performed Sentiment Analysis on Tweets posted by USA President Donald Trump

Steps involves:
1.	Getting 1000 most recent tweets using Twitter API
2.	Cleaning tweets (removing hash tags, hyperlinks and RT)
3.	Find subjectivity and Polarity on each tweet and saved as separate column in data frame
4.	Create WordCloud
5.	Compute negative (-1), neutral (0) and positive (+1) analysis
6.	Visualizing subjectivity and Polarity on Scatter Plot
7.	Finding Total percentage of positive and negative Tweets
